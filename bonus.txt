Bonus Features Implemented:
1. Authentication for Dedicated Folder:
    The project implements authentication for a dedicated folder named "secret".
    When a user attempts to access any resource within the "secret" folder, the server requires authentication.
    If the user provides incorrect credentials or fails to authenticate, the server responds with an "Unauthorized" status code (401), indicating that access to the requested resource is denied.
    The credentials for authentication are hard-coded within the Config class as username ("admin") and password ("1234") constants.
    This is not an ideal practice as credentials should typically be stored securely and retrieved from a secure source like environment variables, databases, or a secure vault.
    However, for the sake of simplicity, the credentials are directly embedded within the codebase.

2. Support for Uploading HTML Files to the Server:
    The server supports file uploads, specifically HTML files, via a POST request to the path "/upload".
    Users can conveniently upload HTML files using a button provided in the index.html file.
    This feature is implemented in a basic stage where only HTML files can be uploaded.
    After a successful upload, After a successful upload, the server returns an HTML response containing a link to the newly uploaded HTML file.
    The file becomes accessible through the browser, allowing users to view HTML content served directly from the server.
    This feature enables users to dynamically add content to the server and serve HTML pages without needing to manually add them to the server's file system.

3. Addition of Tests for Each Class:
    Each class in the project has been accompanied by tests covering both successful and failure scenarios.
    These tests ensure that the functionality of each class behaves as expected under normal conditions and gracefully handles unexpected inputs or errors.
